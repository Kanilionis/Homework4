# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

As you proceed in your career as a web developer, you will probably be asked to complete a coding assessment, which is typically a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive challenges. Build a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## User Story

```
AS A coding bootcamp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

 ### Pseudo Code
 
start the timer when the user clicks the button to start the quiz

each question will be an object (keys and values), we will store the answers in an array

custom attributes for the correct answer

create questions
question:
1 answer
2 answer
3 answer
4 answer
which one is correct answer (create custom attributes)

keep track of how many questions have been answered and where the timer is...clear out of timer when game is over

create functions for each step

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
**done** THEN a timer starts 
    THEN I am presented with a question (how does this happen? Use setTimeout(initialFunction, 2000))
WHEN I answer a question correctly (how will the code know that it is the correct answer?)
    THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
    THEN time is subtracted from the clock (global variables)
    THEN I am presented with another question (function)
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
    THEN the game is over (function)
WHEN the game is over
    THEN I can save my initials and score
```
